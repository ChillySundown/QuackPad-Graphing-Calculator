## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Graph Rendering**  
  Smooth, high-FPS plotting of **polynomial** and **trigonometric** functions with zero perceptible lag.

- **Advanced Expression Parsing**  
  Custom-built parser using the **Shunting Yard algorithm** with full support for:
  - Nested functions (`sin(cos(x))`, `(x+2)^3`, etc.)
  - Variables and constants
  - Edge-case handling for malformed or extreme inputs

- **Interactive Graph Controls**  
  - **Zoom** and **pan** with precision
  - Persistent input history for rapid recall
  - Intuitive UI optimized for exploration and experimentation

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  Clearly communicates syntax errors, invalid domains, and other computational issues in real-time.
